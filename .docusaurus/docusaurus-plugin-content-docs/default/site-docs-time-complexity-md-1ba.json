  "title": "Time Complexity",
  "description": "Time Complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that describes the amount of computational time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. It provides a theoretical estimate of the time required for an algorithm to complete, helping us understand and compare the efficiency of different algorithms.",
