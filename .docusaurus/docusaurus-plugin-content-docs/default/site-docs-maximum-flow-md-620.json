  "description": "Maximum Flow is a fundamental problem in network theory that involves finding the maximum amount of flow that can be sent from a source node to a sink node in a flow network. A flow network is a directed graph where each edge has a capacity (maximum amount of flow it can carry) and actual flow (amount currently passing through).",
